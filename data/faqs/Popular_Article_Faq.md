# Popular Article & FAQ

## Question 1: What is VIN (Vehicle Identitification Number)?
**Answer:** Every automobile has a unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) that contains information about that vehicle. You can find your 17-digit VIN:
- At the base of your vehicle's windshield, on the driver's side
- On your vehicle registration
- On your insurance statement or proof-of-insurance card
- On your Honda Financial Services statement
- On new owner surveys or customer satisfaction surveys sent by American Honda Motor Co, Inc.
Valid VIN numbers use the letters A-Z and numbers 0-9, except for the letters I, O, and Q. If the VIN is not working properly, check to see if letters and numbers have been accidentally inserted. Make sure the letter O was not entered in place of the number 0. Also, make sure the correct number of characters has been entered.

## Question 2: What type of motor oil should I use in my Acura?
**Answer:** Acura Genuine Motor Oil is specifically formulated for your vehicle as it meets Acura's exacting engineering standards. These standards meet or exceed the typical industry performance specifications found in many conventional fluids. Tested and approved by Acura's Research and Development team, Acura Genuine Motor Oil helps maintain the factory specifications of your Acura.

## Question 3: Should I use premium-grade synthetic or ultimate full synthetic oil in my Acura?
**Answer:** Acura recommends using Acura Genuine Motor Oil , sold and available at [Acura dealers](https://mygarage.honda.com/s/find-a-dealer?brand=acura). If Acura Genuine Motor Oil is not used, conventional motor oil of a premium-grade or an ultimate full synthetic blend may be used and must contain the specified viscosity grade indicated in your [Owner's Manual](https://mygarage.honda.com/s/manuals-search?brand=acura). It must also be labeled with an API Certification Seal, indicating the oil is energy conserving and that it meets the [American Petroleum Institute's (API) latest requirement] (https://www.api.org/products-and-services/engine-oil/eolcs-categories-and-classifications/oil-categories#tab-gasoline). Oil additives are not required and not recommended; using them could adversely affect your vehicle engine's performance and durability.

Please see your Owner's Manual  Recommended Engine Oil, for a list of manufacturer-approved fluids.

## Question 4: What is the benefit of using Acura Premium-grade Synthetic Motor Oil?
**Answer:** Exceeds API (SN and ILSAC GF-5 standards)[https://www.api.org/Standards]
- Helps improve fuel efficiency
- Helps minimize the formation of sludge and varnish
- Helps protect against rust and bearing corrosion
- Resists viscosity and thermal breakdown even in the most severe service
- Helps protect engine-powered emission system catalysts, mitigating harmful effects of pollutants in the exhaust gas

## Question 5: What is the benefit of using Acura Ultimate Full Synthetic Motor Oil?
**Answer:** 
- Exceeds API standards, including those for turbocharged engines
- Helps minimize harmful engine deposits while helping maximize fuel efficiency
- Helps improve protection against viscosity breakdown at high temperatures
- Lower volatility for reduced oil consumption
- Helps protect turbocharged engines
- Circulates faster at lower temperatures to provide better protection in cold starts

## Question 6: I have been using Genuine Honda Motor Oil or another commercial engine oil of suitable viscosity, but I am thinking of switching to synthetic motor oil. Can I do this?
**Answer:** Yes, as long as the synthetic motor oil is labeled with the API Certification Seal and is the specified viscosity grade. Keep in mind that your vehicle's oil change intervals will remain the same even if you use synthetic oil.
